Gotes on installing RedHat
--------------------------
- Problem #1: SATA hard drive not recognized. Looks like this is fixed in
  newer version of Red Hat Enterprise 3 (update 2 or 3). See
  http://www.redhat.com/archives/taroon-list/2004-August/msg00166.html

  - Fixed using latest (v3 update 3).

- Problem #2: Problem recognizing display card
  - Set following fields in /etc/X11/XF86Config:
    Driver      "vesa"
    VendorName  "Videocard vendor"
    BoardName   "VESA driver (generic)"

- Problem #3: Can't mount /home/mbopf - no good clues; just shutdown and restart. Possible
  problem with /etc/mtab?? Errors in /var/log/messages don't really help...

- Problem with ant and Java 1.5 (OLD and out of date!!! - MWB 29Apr2013)
  - Ant kept using old version of java. Fixed by uninstalling old RH ant 
    rpm (1.5.2) and installing latest version (1.6.2) in /opt. Added soft link
    from /opt/ant to /opt/apache-ant-1.6.2. 
  - Created /etc/profile.d/java.sh script which defines JAVA_HOME & ANT_HOME,
    and adds them to the PATH.
  - Java is installed in /usr/java/jdk1.5.0. Added a '/usr/j2se' soft link
    which points to it. JAVA_HOME uses the latter such that when an upgrade
    is made, we can simply add it and change the link.

- To set up an alternate NISDOMAIN server, edit /etc/yp.conf

Keyboard Navigation:

See: http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/tip/2289.html

Also, kernel has support for "virtual terminals". CTRL-ALT-F2 will put you into
another shell. CTRL-ALT-F7 will return to the GUI. See:
http://www.unixguide.net/linux/linuxshortcuts.shtml and
http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/shortcuts.html.

There's also "mouse emulation" mode under X:

> It's not a specifically Gnome thing, but there is a way to 
> control the pointer via the keyboard in X. I found it in the
> WindowMaker README (/usr/doc/WindowMaker/README) by accident,
> and it came in extremely handy when I recently discovered that
> my mouse objected to being covered in coffee.
> 
> You enable and disable it by hitting control-shift-numberlock. 
> Apparently the speaker should beep but mine never does.
> 
> Then you use the number pad to move around:
> 
> / * - 	select mouse buttons: first, second, third in that order
> . 8 .	becomes 	. 	up 	. 
> 4 . 6	becomes		left	.	right
> . 2 .	becomes 	.	down	.
> 
> Holding one of 2,4,6,8 down and pressing number 5 down speeds the mouse up.
> Pressing 5 down on its own does a mouse click with the current button.
> Pressing + down on its own does a double-click with the current button.
> 0 clicks and holds down the current button.
> . releases the button that 0 held down.


scp
---
Note - this command doesn't seem to like current .bash_profile/.bashrc. Need to
move them on remote host (archive) before running. Don't know why...
Example:
scp ./cvsDiff.jar archive.nlm.nih.gov:/home/mbopf/tmp
scp archive.nlm.nih.gov:/home/mbopf/tmp/cvsDiff.jar ./cvsDiff.jar


Missing modules when installing from rpm
----------------------------------------
Error when trying to install pine (rpm -ivh pine-4.64-1.i386.rpm):
error: Failed dependencies:
        libldap.so.2 is needed by pine-4.64-1.i386
    Suggested resolutions:
        compat-openldap-2.1.30-4.i386.rpm

Following command finds necessary rpm (as suggested above):
prompt> rpm -q --redhatprovides libldap.so.2
compat-openldap-2.1.30-4

Go to:
http://www.rpmfind.net/
and search for "compat-openldap" (old version number wasn't found). 


/bin/ls: Argument list too long
-------------------------------
Basic problem is that ARG_MAX is normally set to 128K which is kind of small.
Run "getconf ARG_MAX" to verify this. Can't be changed without recompiling
kernel. On solution is to try the Solaris side since it is often higher.

Better solution is to avoid the issue by using "find" and/or possibly using
the xargs command. E.g,

find /path/with/lots/of/images/ -name "*.tif" > /tmp/script.sh
 -- OR --
find /path/with/lots/of/images/ -name "*.tif" -exec rm {} \;

See: http://www.redhat.com/archives/valhalla-list/2002-December/msg00407.html

X11 Forwarding
--------------
To reiterate our brief discussion before I ran out tonight. If you want to
display remote X11 clients on your computer, first connect to the remote
computer using the "-Y" option to ssh and then run the X11 client from the
remote ssh connection.

Here is a nice little article explaining how it works and why there are still
some pitfalls and you should only do it on machines you trust:

  http://www.hackinglinuxexposed.com/articles/20040705.html

  I remember now what you were saying about our new security measures getting
  in the way of old practices. I recall now that standard system hardening
  procedures configure X11 servers not to listen for external connections (at
  port 6000 and above).

Mounting vfat usb flash (in rw mode, sans root password - updated 2016.10.05)
----------------------------
1) sudo mkdir /media/flashdisk/[name]
2) sudo mount -v -o uid=mbopf,gid=users /dev/sdc1 /media/flashdisk/[name]

- Note: first device is usually sdc1, next is sdd1, etc. Use these commands:
# sudo fdisk -l | grep sd
# dmesg | grep sd

To unmount either do:
1) sudo umount /media/flashdisk/[name]
 --- OR ---
2) sudo caja
  - right click on drives to unmount them

Creating ISO image on USB Flash for installation
------------------------------------------------
1) Download ISO image for distro
2) Run "dmesg" on command line, plug USB drive into socket, and note the name 
   of the connected device (normally sdb, sdc, etc.)
> dmesg
sd 12:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg3 type 0
[3893769.692686] sd 12:0:0:0: [sdc] 60063744 512-byte logical blocks: (30.7 GB/28.6 GiB)
[3893769.693712] sd 12:0:0:0: [sdc] Write Protect is off
[3893769.693715] sd 12:0:0:0: [sdc] Mode Sense: 43 00 00 00
[3893769.693939] sd 12:0:0:0: [sdc] Write cache: disabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA
[3893769.706309]  sdc: sdc1 sdc2
[3893769.707856] sd 12:0:0:0: [sdc] Attached SCSI removable disk

3) Login as root:
> sudo -s

4) Make sure that the device is not mounted. Following command should return
nothing:
> findmnt /dev/sdc
> findmnt /dev/sdc1
> findmnt /dev/sdc2

4b) If you get a result like the following:
TARGET                                    SOURCE    FSTYPE  OPTIONS
/run/media/mbopf/Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS amd64 /dev/sdc1 iso9660 ro,nosuid,nodev,relatime,uid=21259,gid=21

run umount based on the TARGET:
> unmount /run/media/mbopf/Ubuntu\ 16.04.3\ LTS\ amd64

4c) Alternatively, running the df command will show mounted drives.

5) Carefully use the "dd" command to write the ISO image. Make sure you get 
   the drive letters correct or you could overwrite your hard drive!!!

> dd if=/home/mbopf/Desktop/ubuntu-16.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdc bs=512k

Format usb Flash drive using "gparted"
---------------------------------------
Run "gparted" as described here:
https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/17001/how-to-format-a-usb-drive-in-ubuntu-using-gparted/


tcpdump command - used to "snoop" on IP traffic
---------------
- Possibly useful, but didn't actually see "bytes going across":

1) login as root
2) run command:
  /usr/sbin/tcpdump -vv -A -s 0 not host lhcsss.nlm.nih.gov and not host lhcsss2 and not host ceb-netapp10910
3) may want to redirect to file

Here is another version that works better for listening to HTTP POST commands
which returns all traffic between archive & local machine:

sudo /usr/sbin/tcpdump -XSs 0 host 130.14.52.14
 -OR-
sudo /usr/sbin/tcpdump -XSs 0 host 130.14.52.14 >& ~/outfile


Enscript (9Feb2009)
-------------------
- Due to changes in enscript, had to copy entire /usr/share/enscript/hl 
  directory to ~/.enscript and modified only the style_emacs.st file to
  provide better colors for printing.
- For listing of color names, see /usr/share/X11/rgb.txt (it's deprecated).

Writing Data DVDs (not working as of 27 July 2009)
(Got this to work after a couple DVD remounts on 16Aug2010)
-----------------
From: 
http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-linux-write-burn-data-to-dvd-or-dvdrw.html

[Note - I currently had to be 'root' in order to access /dev/dvd]

First create the ISO image
# mkisofs -r -o /tmp/var-www-disk1.iso /var/www

Now use the growisofs command to write the ISO onto the DVD:
# growisofs -Z /dev/dvd=/tmp/var-www-disk1.iso

To append more data for same DVD:
# growisofs -M /dev/dvd /tmp/file.1

To format (erase) a DVD:
# dvd+rw-format -force /dev/dvd
The dvd+rw-format command formats dvd disk in the specified dvd drive.

To display information about dvd drive and disk using dvd+rw-mediainfo command:
# dvd+rw-mediainfo /dev/dvd

Visit official web site: http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD+RW/

Mount DVD/CD
------------
As root:
#mkdir /media/dvd (if doesn't exist)
#mount /dev/hda /media/dvd


Trying to create ISO CD (28Apr2010)
-----------------------------------
1) Make sure the "haldaemon" or "hald" service is running
2) Verify that System->Preferences->Removable Drives and Media Preferences" is
set to "Burn a CD or DVD when blank disc inserted"
3) Insert blank CD, preferrably RW in case of bad burn
4) The Nautilus "File Browser" should pop up, if not bring it up
5) Find the ISO you wish burn burn. Right click and select "Burn to Disc"
6) Don't choose "Fastest possible" burn speed, as this can make a coaster. 2x
worked okay for a RW

New way to set up Java so version can be selected (not automatically updated)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Download latest jdk-[version]-linux-x64.tar.gz version of JDK, unpack it, and 
  place directory in /usr/java.
- Create or update symbolic link named "latest" to point to most recent jdk.
- Links in /usr/bin point to /usr/java/latest

Mount AMIT share
----------------
sudo mkdir /amit-project
sudo mount lhcdevfiler:/vol/ceb/amit-project /amit-project

Services
--------
RHEL 7 now uses "systemctl" to start, stop, and enable services
So the following will start up tomcat:

sudo systemctl start tomcat
 - OR -
sudo sytemctl enable glassfish

The services are now found in /usr/lib/systemd/system instead of /etc/init.d

Remote Desktop (7 Apr 2016)
---------------------------
Followed process in http://www.itworld.com/article/2988289/linux/how-to-install-and-use-rdesktop-the-remote-desktop-client-for-linux.html

Following steps most important:

# tar xvzf rdesktop-1.8.3.tar.gz
# cd rdesktop-1.8.3

Needed to add the openssl-devel libraries, but all worked well after that

#sudo yum install openssl-devel

# ./configure --disable-credssp --disable-smartcard
# make
# sudo make install

- Also modified ~/bin/rdesktop/rdesktopScript.sh to use /usr/local/bin

Problem using ssh to login to ceb (Apr. 19, 2016)
------------------------------------------------
Using ssh to log into "ceb" wouldn't work, but the IP (130.14.52.14) did. Leif
realized that the file /etc/gai.conf needed world read, so changed it from 600
to 644.

Size of desktop icons is determined by Nautilus setting:
org.gnome.nautilus.icon-view
The default is 'large' with smaller options being 'standard' and 'small'.

This value can be set by opening the Nautilus file manager, and hitting
"CTRL -" to get preferred size. Or, run "dconf-editor" and select
org->gnome->nautilus->icon-view->default-zoom-level
